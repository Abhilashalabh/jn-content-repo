# Quantum mechanics

Earlier elctron was thought of particle nature. Some scienticts were able to demostrate the wave nature of electron. After sometime, Schrodinger uses the mathematical equation used in classical wave Theory of Physics to characterize the motion of electron around nucleus. Then Quantum mathematical model was developed to study nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. Quatum mechanics looks very complex however, when you able to visualize like a sound wave on a guitar string it becomes simple. Lets us use this to understand distribution of electron in an atom.

## Distribution of elctrons in an atomic

### Atomic orbitals


### aufbau principle

### pauli exclusion principle
### Hund's Rule
        
## Ionic and Covalent Bonds

## How to represent structure of compound
    - Lewis Structure
    - Condensed Structure
## Atomic orbitals in 3D
    - shapes of s,p,d orbitals
    - Heisenberg uncertainty principle
## Introduction to Molecular Orbital Theory
