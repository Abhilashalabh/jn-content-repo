## Introduction

Welcome to this course of basics of organic Chemistry. You will findf this course very intresting as this course has almost no mugging concepts. We will see that it is just like fourth standard mathmatics, once you master it you can solve the question in minimun time

### Organic Compounds

Earlier Scienticts belived that Organic compound are derived from living organism. They contain a vital force which is not present in non-living organism.
